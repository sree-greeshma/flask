# Flask Random Password Generator

This is a simple Flask web application that generates a random password based on user input. This Python code constitutes a Flask web application designed to generate random passwords based on user input. Leveraging the Flask framework, the application establishes a basic web interface where users can visit the homepage, input their desired password length through a form, and subsequently trigger the generation of a password. The underlying password generation logic involves shuffling a character set comprising uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. The generated password is then displayed to the user. The code ensures a simple yet effective implementation of a password generation tool, with easy integration and customization facilitated by Flask's minimalist structure.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

2. Run the Flask application:

```bash

Replace `your_app_name.py` with the actual name of your Flask application script.

3. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Usage
